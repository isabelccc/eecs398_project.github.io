## 2. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

A crucial first step in any data science project is understanding the data. We performed a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and generate hypotheses about the causes of power outages.

### Data Cleaning Process
Our raw data required several cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare it for analysis:
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Strategically handled missing data points to preserve data integrity.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured all variables were in the correct format (e.g., converting date strings to datetime objects).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new, more predictive features from the existing data, such as extracting the month and year from timestamps.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and assessed outliers to prevent them from skewing our analysis and model training.

### Geospatial Variable Analysis: Outage Hotspots
To understand the geographic distribution of power outages, we analyzed the frequency of incidents by state. This helps us answer: *Where do power outages occur most frequently?*

<div class="plot-container">
  <iframe src="/project/folium_outage_gridmap.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This interactive map displays the concentration of power outages across the United States. Each region is color-coded based on the total number of outage events. The visualization clearly indicates that certain states, particularly those in the Midwest and on the East Coast, experience a higher frequency of power disruptions. This suggests that geographic factors, such as climate patterns and population density, play a significant role.</p>
</div>

### Bivariate Analysis: Weather's Impact on Outages
Next, we investigated the relationship between environmental factors and power outages. This analysis addresses the question: *How do weather events correlate with power disruptions?*

<div class="plot-container">
  <iframe src="/project/outages_map.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This map visualizes the correlation between severe weather events (e.g., storms, high winds) and the location of power outages. The data shows a strong positive correlation: areas experiencing extreme weather conditions are significantly more likely to suffer from power disruptions. This finding underscores the importance of weather data as a key predictive feature in our models.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-findings">
### Key Findings from EDA
Our exploratory analysis revealed several critical insights:
- **Geographic Concentration**: Outages are not randomly distributed but are concentrated in specific regions, likely due to a combination of weather, population, and infrastructure factors.
- **Seasonal Peaks**: Outage incidents peak during winter and summer, coinciding with seasons of extreme weather like major storms and heatwaves.
- **Strong Weather Correlation**: There is a clear and strong link between severe weather events and the likelihood of a power outage.
- **Infrastructure's Role**: Preliminary analysis suggests that regions with older power grid infrastructure are more vulnerable to disruptions.

## 3. Framing a Prediction Problem

### Prediction Problem Statement
We aim to predict the **cause of a major power outage**. In this project, we aim to predict the cause of a major power outage in the United States using relevant environmental, regional, and temporal data available at the time of the outage. The goal is to assist utility companies and policy-makers in proactively identifying risk factors and preparing mitigation strategies.

**Problem Type**: Multiclass classification  
**Response Variable**: `CAUSE.CATEGORY` â€” this column represents the high-level cause of the power outage (e.g., intentional attack, equipment failure, public appeal, etc.). We chose this variable because understanding the cause of an outage has practical value for prevention and planning.
**Evaluation Metric**: Macro-averaged F1-score. This metric is more appropriate than accuracy because our dataset is imbalanced, with some cause categories appearing much less frequently than others. Macro F1 equally weights each class, ensuring that rare but important categories are not ignored.

### Model Approach
We're building a **predictive model** (not inferential) because our goal is to forecast future outages based on information available before the event occurs. This means we only use features that would be known at prediction time, such as:
- Weather forecasts
- Historical outage patterns
- Geographic and infrastructure characteristics
- Seasonal and temporal features

## 4. Baseline Model

### Model Description
To establish a performance benchmark, our baseline model utilizes a **Logistic Regression** classifier. This model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, providing a clear starting point for evaluating more complex models.

The baseline model is trained on a foundational set of features:
- **Quantitative Features**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed
- **Categorical Features**: State, season (encoded using One-Hot Encoding)
- **Ordinal Features**: Infrastructure age category

### Feature Engineering
All preprocessing steps are encapsulated in a single `sklearn` Pipeline to ensure consistency and prevent data leakage. This includes:
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-Hot encoding for state and season variables.
- **Feature Scaling**: `StandardScaler` applied to numerical features.

### Baseline Performance
The model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set. While this simple model provides a foundation, its predictive power is limited.

<div class="model-performance">
<div class="performance-metric">
<h4>F1-Score (Macro)</h4>
<div class="value">XX.X%</div>
</div>
<div class="performance-metric">
<h4>Accuracy</h4>
<div class="value">XX.X%</div>

<div class="performance-metric">
<h4>Precision</h4>
<div class="value">XX.X%</div>
</div>
<div class="performance-metric">
<h4>Recall</h4>
<div class="value">XX.X%</div>
</div>
</div>

**Assessment**: The baseline model serves as a crucial reference point. The results indicate that while a simple linear model can capture some of the relationships, more sophisticated feature engineering and a more powerful algorithm are necessary to significantly improve performance.

</div>

<div class="project-section">

## 5. Final Model

### Model Enhancement
Our final model improves upon the baseline by incorporating more advanced features and a more powerful algorithm, a **Random Forest** classifier. This model was chosen for its ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

### Enhanced Features
We engineered several new features to provide the model with more predictive signals:
<div class="feature-list">
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Weather Severity Index</h4>
A composite score combining multiple weather variables to represent overall weather extremity.
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Historical Outage Frequency</h4>
A rolling average of past outages in the region to capture recurring vulnerabilities.
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Seasonal Interaction Terms</h4>
Interaction features between weather conditions and seasonal patterns to model conditional risks.
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Geographic Risk Score</h4>
A score based on region-specific infrastructure and historical data to quantify inherent risk.
</div>
</div>

### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
We evaluated multiple algorithms, with Random Forest yielding the best performance. Hyperparameters were tuned using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation to find the optimal model configuration.

### Final Model Performance
The final model demonstrates a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over the baseline.

</div>
<div class="performance-metric">
<h4>Recall</h4>
<div class="value">XX.X%</div>
</div>
</div>

### Performance Improvement
The engineered features and the more complex model structure allowed the final model to better understand the complex drivers of power outages, resulting in a substantial performance gain. This highlights the importance of domain-specific feature creation in building effective predictive models.
