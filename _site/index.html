# EECS 398 Final Project: Predicting Power Outages in the U.S.

## Overview

This project analyzes power outage patterns across the United States using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to understand the factors that contribute to power outages and build predictive models to help utility companies and emergency responders prepare for potential disruptions.

**Dataset**: Power Outage Data across the United States  
**Team**: xiulin Chen  
**Course**: EECS 398 - Practical Data Science (Spring 2025)

## 1. Introduction and Question Identification

### Dataset Overview
Our analysis focuses on power outage data collected across the United States, examining various factors that contribute to outage occurrences including weather conditions, geographic location, infrastructure age, and historical patterns.

**Key Questions We Investigate:**
- What are the primary factors that contribute to power outages?
- Can we predict the likelihood and severity of power outages based on weather and geographic data?
- How do different regions of the United States compare in terms of outage frequency and patterns?

**Why This Matters:**
Power outages can have significant economic and social impacts, affecting everything from healthcare facilities to transportation systems. Understanding and predicting these events can help utility companies improve infrastructure resilience and emergency response planning.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning Process
Our data cleaning involved several key steps:
- **Missing Value Handling**: Identified and appropriately handled missing data points
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured proper data types for analysis (dates, categories, numerical values)
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data (e.g., time-based features, geographic aggregations)
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled extreme values that could skew our analysis

### Univariate Analysis
We examined the distributions of key variables to understand the underlying patterns in our data.

### Bivariate Analysis
We explored relationships between different variables to identify potential correlations and causal factors.

</div>

<div class="key-findings">
### Key Findings from EDA
- **Geographic Patterns**: Certain regions show higher outage frequencies due to weather patterns and infrastructure age
- **Seasonal Trends**: Outages peak during extreme weather seasons (winter storms, summer heat waves)
- **Weather Correlation**: Strong correlation between extreme weather events and outage occurrences
- **Infrastructure Impact**: Older infrastructure shows higher vulnerability to weather-related outages

## 3. Framing a Prediction Problem

### Prediction Problem Statement
We aim to predict the **likelihood of a power outage occurring** in a given geographic region within a specific time window, based on weather forecasts and historical data.

**Problem Type**: Binary Classification  
**Response Variable**: Outage occurrence (Yes/No)  
**Evaluation Metric**: F1-Score (chosen for its balance between precision and recall, important for emergency planning)

### Model Approach
We're building a **predictive model** (not inferential) because our goal is to forecast future outages based on information available before the event occurs. This means we only use features that would be known at prediction time, such as:
- Weather forecasts
- Historical outage patterns
- Geographic and infrastructure characteristics
- Seasonal and temporal features

<div class="feature-list">
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Weather Features</h4>
Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Geographic Features</h4>
State, region, population density
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Temporal Features</h4>
Time of year, day of week, historical patterns
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Infrastructure Features</h4>
Age of power infrastructure, maintenance records
</div>
</div>

</div>

## 4. Baseline Model

### Model Description
Our baseline model uses a **Logistic Regression** classifier with the following features:
- **Quantitative Features**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed
- **Categorical Features**: State, season (encoded using One-Hot Encoding)
- **Ordinal Features**: Infrastructure age category

### Feature Engineering
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-Hot encoding for state and season variables
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler applied to numerical features
- **Pipeline Implementation**: All preprocessing steps implemented in a single sklearn Pipeline

## 5. Final Model

### Enhanced Features
We engineered several new features to improve model performance:

<div class="feature-list">
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Weather Severity Index</h4>
Combined multiple weather variables into a single severity score
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Historical Outage Frequency</h4>
Rolling average of past outages in the region
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Seasonal Interaction Terms</h4>
Interactions between weather conditions and seasonal patterns
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h4>Geographic Risk Score</h4>

### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
We evaluated multiple algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines. **Random Forest** performed best for our use case.

**Hyperparameters Tuned:**
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples required to split a node
- `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum samples required at leaf node

**Tuning Method**: GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
