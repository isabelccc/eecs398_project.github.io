## 2. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

A crucial first step in any data science project is understanding the data. We performed a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and generate hypotheses about the causes of power outages.

### Data Cleaning Process
Our raw data required several cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare it for analysis:
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Strategically handled missing data points to preserve data integrity.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured all variables were in the correct format (e.g., converting date strings to datetime objects).
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new, more predictive features from the existing data, such as extracting the month and year from timestamps, calculate the duration.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and assessed outliers to prevent them from skewing our analysis and model training.

### Key Findings from EDA
Our exploratory analysis revealed several critical insights:
- **Geographic Concentration**: Outages are not randomly distributed but are concentrated in specific regions, likely due to a combination of weather, population, and infrastructure factors.
- **Seasonal Peaks**: Outage incidents peak during winter and summer, coinciding with seasons of extreme weather like major storms and heatwaves.
- **Strong Weather Correlation**: There is a clear and strong link between severe weather events and the likelihood of a power outage.
- **Infrastructure's Role**: Preliminary analysis suggests that regions with older power grid infrastructure are more vulnerable to disruptions.

## Interactive Data Visualizations

This section provides interactive visualizations of the power outage data, allowing for a deeper exploration of the patterns and trends discussed in the analysis.



### Bivariate Analysis: Weather's Impact on Outages
Next, we investigated the relationship between environmental factors and power outages. This analysis addresses the question: *How do weather events correlate with power disruptions?*

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/outages_map.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Analysis:** This map visualizes the correlation between severe weather events (e.g., storms, high winds) and the location of power outages. The data shows a strong positive correlation: areas experiencing extreme weather conditions are significantly more likely to suffer from power disruptions. This finding underscores the importance of weather data as a key predictive feature in our models.

## Further Visual Analysis

To deepen our understanding, we created additional visualizations focusing on different dimensions of the outage data.

### Temporal Trends: Outages Over Time
This line chart helps us identify seasonality and long-term trends in power outage occurrences.

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/outages_over_time.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Analysis:** This visualization tracks the number of power outages month by month. Clear seasonal peaks can be observed, particularly during the summer and winter months, which typically correspond to periods of extreme weather. This confirms the seasonal patterns suggested in our initial EDA and highlights the predictive power of time-based features.

### Severity Analysis: Outage Duration by Cause
Understanding which types of incidents lead to the longest outages is crucial for resource planning.

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/duration_by_cause.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Analysis:** This bar chart compares the average outage duration for different causes. It reveals that events like severe weather lead to significantly longer restoration times compared to equipment failure. This insight can help utility companies prioritize and allocate resources more effectively during different types of crises.



### Regional Analysis: Outages by Climate Zone
This treemap provides a proportional view of outage distribution across different climate regions.

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/outages_by_region.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Analysis:** This visualization breaks down the total number of outages by climate region. It offers a different perspective from the state-level map, highlighting that certain climate zones are inherently more susceptible to power disruptions. This reinforces the idea that regional climate characteristics are a strong predictive signal.

## 3. Framing a Prediction Problem

### Prediction Problem Statement
We aim to predict the **cause of a major power outage**. In this project, we aim to predict the cause of a major power outage in the United States using relevant environmental, regional, and temporal data available at the time of the outage. The goal is to assist utility companies and policy-makers in proactively identifying risk factors and preparing mitigation strategies.

**Problem Type**: Multiclass classification  
**Response Variable**: `CAUSE.CATEGORY` â€” this column represents the high-level cause of the power outage (e.g., intentional attack, equipment failure, public appeal, etc.). We chose this variable because understanding the cause of an outage has practical value for prevention and planning.
**Evaluation Metric**: Macro-averaged F1-score. This metric is more appropriate than accuracy because our dataset is imbalanced, with some cause categories appearing much less frequently than others. Macro F1 equally weights each class, ensuring that rare but important categories are not ignored.

### Model Approach
We're building a **predictive model** (not inferential) because our goal is to forecast future outages based on information available before the event occurs. This means we only use features that would be known at prediction time, such as:
- Weather forecasts
- Historical outage patterns
- Geographic and infrastructure characteristics
- Seasonal and temporal features

### Variables Used in the Model

Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive set of variables from the power outage dataset. Below is a detailed breakdown of all variables considered in our model:

| Variable Name | Description | Data Type | Role in Model | Source |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Response Variable** |

**Secondary Predictors:**
- **Demographic Variables**: Population density and land use characteristics that may indicate infrastructure stress
- **Impact Variables**: `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED` - May indicate system vulnerability patterns

**Feature Engineering:**
- **`DURATION_HOURS`**: Calculated from start and restoration times to capture outage severity
- **`LAT`/`LON`**: Geographic coordinates for spatial analysis and mapping
- **Seasonal Features**: Derived from `MONTH` to capture seasonal patterns

#### Data Quality Considerations:

## 4. Baseline Model

### Model Description
To establish a performance benchmark, our baseline model utilizes a **Logistic Regression** classifier. This model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, providing a clear starting point for evaluating more complex models.

The baseline model is trained on a foundational set of features:
- **Quantitative Features**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed
- **Categorical Features**: State, season (encoded using One-Hot Encoding)
- **Ordinal Features**: Infrastructure age category

### Feature Engineering
All preprocessing steps are encapsulated in a single `sklearn` Pipeline to ensure consistency and prevent data leakage. This includes:
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-Hot encoding for state and season variables.
- **Feature Scaling**: `StandardScaler` applied to numerical features.
